# Little Omar's Game

This quiz was inspired by my 6 year old brother, Omar! As or right now he is learning about continents, parts of speech, and basic math skills. The questions should be very simple for anyone older than 6 years old (I would hope). Feel free to test out if you're smarter than a 1st grader.

This wep application consists of a timer, which when a question is answered incorrectly, will deduct 15 seconds from your time. If questions are answered correctly, you score 20 points for each one! Check back what your highest score was by clicking 'View Highscore'.
